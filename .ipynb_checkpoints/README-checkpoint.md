# Beyond Knowledge Distillation: Supervised Learning of Semantic Segmentation Inspired by Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms
A pytorch implenment for Beyond Knowledge Distillation: Supervised Learning of Semantic Segmentation Inspired by Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms



## Training and testing

-   Training on one GPU:

```pycon
python train.py {config}
```

-   Testing on one GPU:

```pycon
python test.py {config}
```
{config} means the config path. The config path can be found in [new_configs](new_configs "new_configs").
